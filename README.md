## Images

### Omnigraffle drawings

-   Font: 12pt Guardian Sans Condensed / Ubuntu mono

-   Export as 300 dpi png.

-   Website font is 18 px = 13.5 pt, so scale dpi to match font sizes: 270 = 300 \* 12 / 13.5.
    (I also verified this empirically by screenshotting.)

    ``` r
    #| echo: FALSE
    #| out.width: NULL
    knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/transform.png", dpi = 270)
    ```

### Screenshots

-   Make sure you're using a light theme.
    For small interface elements (eg. toolbars), zoom in twice.

-   Screenshot with Cmd + Shift + 4.

-   Don't need to set dpi:

    ``` r
    #| echo: FALSE
    #| out.width: NULL
    knitr::include_graphics("screenshots/rstudio-wg.png")
    ```
