In this part of the book, you\'ll learn about data wrangling, the art of getting your data into R in a useful form for visualisation and modelling.
Data wrangling is very important: without it you can\'t work with your own data!
Wrangle encompasses three parts of the data science flow: importing, tidying, and transforming.

This part of the book proceeds as follows:

-   In [Chapter -@sec-import-rectangular], you'll learn how to get plain-text data in rectangular formats from disk and into R.

-   In [Chapter -@sec-import-spreadsheets], you'll learn how to get data from Excel spreadsheets and Google Sheets into R.

-   In [Chapter -@sec-import-databases], you'll learn about getting data into R from databases.

-   In [Chapter -@sec-import-webscrape], you'll learn about harvesting data off the web and getting it into R.

-   We'll close up the part with a brief discussion on other types of data and pointers for how to get them into R in [Chapter -@sec-import-other].
