# Preface to the second edition {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the second edition of "R for Data Science".

## Major changes {.unnumbered}

-   The first part is renamed to "whole game" to reflect the entire data science cycle, including a chapter on data import.
-   In the wrangle part highlight improvements to dplyr that make data scientists' lives even easier, such as new functions for rectangling data, working with list columns, and column-wise and row-wise operations.
-   Data import also gains a whole part that goes beyond importing rectangular data to include chapters on working with spreadsheets, databases, and web scraping.
-   The iteration chapter gains a new case study on web scraping from multiple pages.
-   The modeling part has been removed. For modeling, we recommend using packages from [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) and reading [Tidy Modeling with R](https://www.tmwr.org/) by Max Kuhn and Julia Silge to learn more about them.
-   We've switched from the magrittr pipe to the base pipe.
