In this part of the book, you'll learn about data tidying, the art of getting your data into R in a useful form for visualization and modelling.
Data wrangling is very important: without it you can't work with your own data!
There are three main parts to data wrangling:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "75%"

This part of the book proceeds as follows:

-   [Chapter -@sec-list-columns] will give you tools for working with list columns --- data stored in columns of a tibble as lists.

-   In [Chapter -@sec-rectangle-data], you'll learn about hierarchical data formats and how to turn them into rectangular data via unnesting.

<!--# TO DO: Revisit bullet points about new chapters. -->
