Introduction</h1>
<p>In the <a href="#chp-data-visualize" data-type="xref">#chp-data-visualize</a>, you learned much more than just how to make scatterplots, bar charts, and boxplots. You learned a foundation that you can use to make <em>any</em> type of plot with ggplot2.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you’ll expand on that foundation as you learn about the layered grammar of graphics. We’ll start with a deeper dive into aesthetic mappings, geometric objects, and facets. Then, you will learn about statistical transformations ggplot2 makes under the hood when creating a plot. These transformations are used to calculate new values to plot, such as the heights of bars in a bar plot or medians in a box plot. You will also learn about position adjustments, which modify how geoms are displayed in your plots. Finally, we’ll briefly introduce coordinate systems.</p>
<p>We will not cover every single function and option for each of these layers, but we will walk you through the most important and commonly used functionality provided by ggplot2 as well as introduce you to packages that extend ggplot2.</p>

<p>Among the variables in <code>mpg</code> are:</p>
<ol type="1"><li><p><code>displ</code>: A car’s engine size, in liters. A numerical variable.</p></li>
<li><p><code>hwy</code>: A car’s fuel efficiency on the highway, in miles per gallon (mpg). A car with a low fuel efficiency consumes more fuel than a car with a high fuel efficiency when they travel the same distance. A numerical variable.</p></li>
<li><p><code>class</code>: Type of car. A categorical variable.</p></li>
</ol><p>You can learn about <code>mpg</code> on its help page by running <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/mpg.html">?mpg</a></code>.</p>
<p>Let’s start by visualizing the relationship between <code>displ</code> and <code>hwy</code> for various <code>class</code>es of cars. We can do this with a scatterplot where the numerical variables are mapped to the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> aesthetics and the categorical variable is mapped to an aesthetic like <code>color</code> or <code>shape</code>.</p>

<p>When <code>class</code> is mapped to <code>shape</code>, we get two warnings:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>1: The shape palette can deal with a maximum of 6 discrete values because more than 6 becomes difficult to discriminate; you have 7. Consider specifying shapes manually if you must have them.</p>
<p>2: Removed 62 rows containing missing values (<code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_point.html">geom_point()</a></code>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since ggplot2 will only use six shapes at a time, by default, additional groups will go unplotted when you use the shape aesthetic. The second warning is related – there are 62 SUVs in the dataset and they’re not plotted.</p>
<p>Similarly, we can map <code>class</code> to <code>size</code> or <code>alpha</code> (transparency) aesthetics as well.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Both of these produce warnings as well:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Using alpha for a discrete variable is not advised.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mapping a non-ordinal discrete (categorical) variable (<code>class</code>) to an ordered aesthetic (<code>size</code> or <code>alpha</code>) is generally not a good idea because it implies a ranking that does not in fact exist.</p>
<p>Similarly, we could have mapped <code>class</code> to the <code>alpha</code> aesthetic, which controls the transparency of the points, or to the <code>shape</code> aesthetic, which controls the shape of the points.</p>
<p>Once you map an aesthetic, ggplot2 takes care of the rest. It selects a reasonable scale to use with the aesthetic, and it constructs a legend that explains the mapping between levels and values. For x and y aesthetics, ggplot2 does not create a legend, but it creates an axis line with tick marks and a label. The axis line acts as a legend; it explains the mapping between locations and values.</p>
<p>You can also set the aesthetic properties of your geom manually. For example, we can make all of the points in our plot blue:</p>
<div class="cell">
<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="r">ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(color = "blue")</pre>
<div class="cell-output-display">
<p><img src="layers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" alt="Scatterplot of highway fuel efficiency versus engine size of cars that shows a negative association. All points are blue." width="576"/></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here, the color doesn’t convey information about a variable, but only changes the appearance of the plot. You can set an aesthetic manually by name as an argument of your geom function. In other words, it goes <em>outside</em> of <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/aes.html">aes()</a></code>. You’ll need to pick a value that makes sense for that aesthetic:</p>
<ul><li>The name of a color as a character string.</li>
<li>The size of a point in mm.</li>
<li>The shape of a point as a number, as shown in <a href="#fig-shapes" data-type="xref">#fig-shapes</a>.</li>
</ul><div class="cell" data-layout-align="center">
<div class="cell-output-display">

<figure id="fig-shapes"><p><img src="layers_files/figure-html/fig-shapes-1.png" alt="Mapping between shapes and the numbers that represent them: 0 - square, 1 - circle, 2 - triangle point up, 3 - plus, 4 - cross, 5 - diamond, 6 - triangle point down, 7 - square cross, 8 - star, 9 - diamond plus, 10 - circle plus, 11 - triangles up and down, 12 - square plus, 13 - circle cross, 14 - square and triangle down, 15 - filled square, 16 - filled circle, 17 - filled triangle point-up, 18 - filled diamond, 19 - solid circle, 20 - bullet (smaller circle), 21 - filled circle blue, 22 - filled square blue, 23 - filled diamond blue, 24 - filled triangle point-up blue, 25 - filled triangle point down blue." width="576"/></p>
<figcaption>R has 25 built in shapes that are identified by numbers. There are some seeming duplicates: for example, 0, 15, and 22 are all squares. The difference comes from the interaction of the <code>color</code> and <code>fill</code> aesthetics. The hollow shapes (0–14) have a border determined by <code>color</code>; the solid shapes (15–20) are filled with <code>color</code>; the filled shapes (21–24) have a border of <code>color</code> and are filled with <code>fill</code>.</figcaption>

<p>So far we have discussed aesthetics that we can map or set in a scatterplot, when using a point geom. You can learn more about all possible aesthetic mappings in the aesthetic specifications vignette at <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2-specs.html" class="uri">https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2-specs.html</a>.</p>
<p>The specific aesthetics you can use for a plot depend on the geom you use to represent the data. In the next section we dive deeper into geoms.</p>

<p>Both plots contain the same x variable, the same y variable, and both describe the same data. But the plots are not identical. Each plot uses a different geometric object, geom, to represent the data. The plot on the left uses the point geom, and the plot on the right uses the smooth geom, a smooth line fitted to the data.</p>
<p>To change the geom in your plot, change the geom function that you add to <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.html">ggplot()</a></code>. For instance, to make the plots above, you can use this code:</p>
<div class="cell">
<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="r"># Left
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point()

# Right
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_smooth()</pre>
</div>
<p>Every geom function in ggplot2 takes a <code>mapping</code> argument. However, not every aesthetic works with every geom. You could set the shape of a point, but you couldn’t set the “shape” of a line. If you try, ggplot2 will silently ignore that aesthetic mapping. On the other hand, you <em>could</em> set the linetype of a line. <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_smooth.html">geom_smooth()</a></code> will draw a different line, with a different linetype, for each unique value of the variable that you map to linetype.</p>
<div class="cell">
<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="r">ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = drv)) + 
  geom_smooth()

  geom_smooth()</pre>
<div class="cell-output-display">
<p><img src="layers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" alt="Two plots of highway fuel efficiency versus engine size of cars. The data are represented with smooth curves. On the left, three smooth curves, all with the same linetype. On the right, three smooth curves with different line types (solid, dashed, or long dashed) for each type of drive train. In both plots, confidence intervals around the smooth curves are also displayed." width="576"/></p>

In both plots, confidence intervals around the smooth curves are also displayed." width="576"/></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here, <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_smooth.html">geom_smooth()</a></code> separates the cars into three lines based on their <code>drv</code> value, which describes a car’s drive train. One line describes all of the points that have a <code>4</code> value, one line describes all of the points that have an <code>f</code> value, and one line describes all of the points that have an <code>r</code> value. Here, <code>4</code> stands for four-wheel drive, <code>f</code> for front-wheel drive, and <code>r</code> for rear-wheel drive.</p>
<p>If this sounds strange, we can make it more clear by overlaying the lines on top of the raw data and then coloring everything according to <code>drv</code>.</p>

<p>Notice that this plot contains two geoms in the same graph.</p>
<p>Many geoms, like <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_smooth.html">geom_smooth()</a></code>, use a single geometric object to display multiple rows of data. For these geoms, you can set the <code>group</code> aesthetic to a categorical variable to draw multiple objects. ggplot2 will draw a separate object for each unique value of the grouping variable. In practice, ggplot2 will automatically group the data for these geoms whenever you map an aesthetic to a discrete variable (as in the <code>linetype</code> example). It is convenient to rely on this feature because the <code>group</code> aesthetic by itself does not add a legend or distinguishing features to the geoms.</p>

<p>If you place mappings in a geom function, ggplot2 will treat them as local mappings for the layer. It will use these mappings to extend or overwrite the global mappings <em>for that layer only</em>. This makes it possible to display different aesthetics in different layers.</p>

<p>You can use the same idea to specify different <code>data</code> for each layer. Here, we use red points as well as open circles to highlight two-seater cars. The local data argument in <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_smooth.html">geom_smooth()</a></code> overrides the global data argument in <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.html">ggplot()</a></code> for that layer only.</p>

<p>(You’ll learn how <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html">filter()</a></code> works in the chapter on data transformations: for now, just know that this command selects only the subcompact cars.)</p>
<p>Geoms are the fundamental building blocks of ggplot2. You can completely transform the look of your plot by changing its geom, and different geoms can reveal different features of your data.

<p>ggplot2 provides more than 40 geoms but these don’t cover all possible plots one could make. If you need a different geom, we recommend looking into extension packages first to see if someone else has already implemented it (see <a href="https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/" class="uri">https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/</a> for a sampling). For example, the <strong>ggridges</strong> package (<a href="https://wilkelab.org/ggridges/" class="uri">https://wilkelab.org/ggridges</a>) is useful for making ridgeline plots, which can be useful for visualizing the density of a numerical variable for different levels of a categorical variable. In the following plot not only did we use a new geom (<code><a href="https://wilkelab.org/ggridges/reference/geom_density_ridges.html">geom_density_ridges()</a></code>), but we have also mapped the same variable to multiple aesthetics (<code>drv</code> to <code>y</code>, <code>fill</code>, and <code>color</code>) as well as set an aesthetic (<code>alpha = 0.5</code>) to make the density curves transparent.</p>

Facets</h1>
<p>In <a href="#chp-data-visualize" data-type="xref">#chp-data-visualize</a> you learned about faceting with <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/facet_wrap.html">facet_wrap()</a></code>, which splits a plot into subplots that each display one subset of the data based on a categorical variable.</p>
<div class="cell">
<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="r">ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +

<p><img src="layers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png" alt="Scatterplot of highway fuel efficiency versus engine size of cars, faceted by class, with facets spanning two rows." width="576"/></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>To facet your plot with the combination of two variables, switch from <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/facet_wrap.html">facet_wrap()</a></code> to <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/facet_grid.html">facet_grid()</a></code>. The first argument of <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/facet_grid.html">facet_grid()</a></code> is also a formula, but now it’s a double sided formula: <code>rows ~ cols</code>.</p>
<div class="cell">
<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="r">ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)</pre>

<p><img src="layers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png" alt="Scatterplot of highway fuel efficiency versus engine size of cars, faceted by number of cylinders across rows and by type of drive train across columns.

</div>
</div>
<p>By default each of the facets share the same scale for x and y axes. This is useful when you want to compare data across facets but it can be limiting when you want to visualize the relationship within each facet better. Setting the <code>scales</code> argument in a faceting function to <code>"free"</code> will allow for different axis scales across both rows and columns. Other options for this argument are <code>"free_x"</code> (different scales across rows) and <code>"free_y"</code> (different scales across columns).</p>

Statistical transformations</h1>
<p>Consider a basic bar chart, drawn with <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_bar.html">geom_bar()</a></code> or <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_bar.html">geom_col()</a></code>. The following chart displays the total number of diamonds in the <code>diamonds</code> dataset, grouped by <code>cut</code>. The <code>diamonds</code> dataset is in the ggplot2 package and contains information on ~54,000 diamonds, including the <code>price</code>, <code>carat</code>, <code>color</code>, <code>clarity</code>, and <code>cut</code> of each diamond. The chart shows that more diamonds are available with high quality cuts than with low quality cuts.</p>
<div class="cell">
<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="r">ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut)) + 
  geom_bar()</pre>
<div class="cell-output-display">
<p><img src="layers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png" alt="Bar chart of number of each cut of diamond. There are roughly 1500 Fair, 5000 Good, 12000 Very Good, 14000 Premium, and 22000 Ideal cut diamonds." width="576"/></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>On the x-axis, the chart displays <code>cut</code>, a variable from <code>diamonds</code>. On the y-axis, it displays count, but count is not a variable in <code>diamonds</code>! Where does count come from? Many graphs, like scatterplots, plot the raw values of your dataset. Other graphs, like bar charts, calculate new values to plot:</p>
<ul><li><p>Bar charts, histograms, and frequency polygons bin your data and then plot bin counts, the number of points that fall in each bin.</p></li>
<li><p>Smoothers fit a model to your data and then plot predictions from the model.</p></li>
<li><p>Boxplots compute a robust summary of the distribution and then display that summary as a specially formatted box.</p></li>
</ul><p>The algorithm used to calculate new values for a graph is called a <strong>stat</strong>, short for statistical transformation. <a href="#fig-vis-stat-bar" data-type="xref">#fig-vis-stat-bar</a> shows how this process works with <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_bar.html">geom_bar()</a></code>.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output-display">

<figure id="fig-vis-stat-bar"><p><img src="images/visualization-stat-bar.png" style="width:100.0%" alt="A figure demonstrating three steps of creating a bar chart. Step 1. geom_bar() begins with the diamonds data set. Step 2. geom_bar() transforms the data with the count stat, which returns a data set of cut values and counts. Step 3. geom_bar() uses the transformed data to build the plot. cut is mapped to the x-axis, count is mapped to the y-axis."/></p>
<figcaption>When create a bar chart we first start with the raw data, then aggregate it to count the number of observations in each bar, and finally map those computed variables to plot aesthetics.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
<p>You can learn which stat a geom uses by inspecting the default value for the <code>stat</code> argument. For example, <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_bar.html">?geom_bar</a></code> shows that the default value for <code>stat</code> is “count”, which means that <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_bar.html">geom_bar()</a></code> uses <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_bar.html">stat_count()</a></code>. <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_bar.html">stat_count()</a></code> is documented on the same page as <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_bar.html">geom_bar()</a></code>. If you scroll down, the section called “Computed variables” explains that it computes two new variables: <code>count</code> and <code>prop</code>.</p>
<p>Every geom has a default stat; and every stat has a default geom. This means that you can typically use geoms without worrying about the underlying statistical transformation. However, there are three reasons why you might need to use a stat explicitly:</p>
<ol type="1"><li>
<p>You might want to override the default stat. In the code below, we change the stat of <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_bar.html">geom_bar()</a></code> from count (the default) to identity. This lets us map the height of the bars to the raw values of a <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> variable.</p>
<div class="cell">
<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="r">cut_frequencies &lt;- tribble(
  ~cut,         ~freq,

  "Good",       4906,
  "Very Good",  12082,
  "Premium",    13791,
  "Ideal",      21551
)

ggplot(cut_frequencies, aes(x = cut, y = freq)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")</pre>
<div class="cell-output-display">
<p><img src="layers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-30-1.png" alt="Bar chart of number of each cut of diamond. There are roughly 1500 Fair, 5000 Good, 12000 Very Good, 14000 Premium, and 22000 Ideal cut diamonds." width="576"/></p>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>You might want to override the default mapping from transformed variables to aesthetics. For example, you might want to display a bar chart of proportions, rather than counts:</p>
<div class="cell">
<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="r">ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, y = after_stat(prop), group = 1)) + 
  geom_bar()</pre>

</div>
</div>
<p>To find the variables computed by the stat, look for the section titled “computed variables” in the help for <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_bar.html">geom_bar()</a></code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You might want to draw greater attention to the statistical transformation in your code. For example, you might use <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/stat_summary.html">stat_summary()</a></code>, which summarizes the y values for each unique x value, to draw attention to the summary that you’re computing:</p>
<div class="cell">
<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="r">ggplot(diamonds) + 
  stat_summary(
    aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    fun.min = min,
    fun.max = max,
    fun = median
  )</pre>
<div class="cell-output-display">

</div>
</div>
</li>
</ol><p>ggplot2 provides more than 20 stats for you to use. Each stat is a function, so you can get help in the usual way, e.g. <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_histogram.html">?stat_bin</a></code>.</p>

<p>There’s one more piece of magic associated with bar charts. You can color a bar chart using either the <code>color</code> aesthetic, or, more usefully, <code>fill</code>:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Note what happens if you map the fill aesthetic to another variable, like <code>clarity</code>: the bars are automatically stacked. Each colored rectangle represents a combination of <code>cut</code> and <code>clarity</code>.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The stacking is performed automatically using the <strong>position adjustment</strong> specified by the <code>position</code> argument. If you don’t want a stacked bar chart, you can use one of three other options: <code>"identity"</code>, <code>"dodge"</code> or <code>"fill"</code>.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><code>position = "identity"</code> will place each object exactly where it falls in the context of the graph. This is not very useful for bars, because it overlaps them.

</ul><p>There’s one other type of adjustment that’s not useful for bar charts, but can be very useful for scatterplots. Recall our first scatterplot. Did you notice that the plot displays only 126 points, even though there are 234 observations in the dataset?</p>

<p>The underlying values of <code>hwy</code> and <code>displ</code> are rounded so the points appear on a grid and many points overlap each other. This problem is known as <strong>overplotting</strong>. This arrangement makes it difficult to see the distribution of the data. Are the data points spread equally throughout the graph, or is there one special combination of <code>hwy</code> and <code>displ</code> that contains 109 values?</p>
<p>You can avoid this gridding by setting the position adjustment to “jitter”. <code>position = "jitter"</code> adds a small amount of random noise to each point. This spreads the points out because no two points are likely to receive the same amount of random noise.</p>
<div class="cell">
<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="r">ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(position = "jitter")</pre>
<div class="cell-output-display">
<p><img src="layers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-40-1.png" alt="Jittered scatterplot of highway fuel efficiency versus engine size of cars. The plot shows a negative association." width="576"/></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Adding randomness seems like a strange way to improve your plot, but while it makes your graph less accurate at small scales, it makes your graph <em>more</em> revealing at large scales. Because this is such a useful operation, ggplot2 comes with a shorthand for <code>geom_point(position = "jitter")</code>: <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_jitter.html">geom_jitter()</a></code>.</p>

Coordinate systems</h1>
<p>Coordinate systems are probably the most complicated part of ggplot2. The default coordinate system is the Cartesian coordinate system where the x and y positions act independently to determine the location of each point. There are two other coordinate systems that are occasionally helpful.</p>

<p><code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/coord_map.html">coord_quickmap()</a></code> sets the aspect ratio correctly for maps. This is very important if you’re plotting spatial data with ggplot2.

<h1>
The layered grammar of graphics</h1>
<p>We can expand on the graphing template you learned in <span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">?sec-graphing-template</span> by adding position adjustments, stats, coordinate systems, and faceting:</p>
<pre><code>ggplot(data = &lt;DATA&gt;) + 
  &lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt;(
     mapping = aes(&lt;MAPPINGS&gt;),
     stat = &lt;STAT&gt;, 
     position = &lt;POSITION&gt;
  ) +
  &lt;COORDINATE_FUNCTION&gt; +
  &lt;FACET_FUNCTION&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Our new template takes seven parameters, the bracketed words that appear in the template. In practice, you rarely need to supply all seven parameters to make a graph because ggplot2 will provide useful defaults for everything except the data, the mappings, and the geom function.</p>
<p>The seven parameters in the template compose the grammar of graphics, a formal system for building plots. The grammar of graphics is based on the insight that you can uniquely describe <em>any</em> plot as a combination of a dataset, a geom, a set of mappings, a stat, a position adjustment, a coordinate system, and a faceting scheme.</p>
<p>To see how this works, consider how you could build a basic plot from scratch: you could start with a dataset and then transform it into the information that you want to display (with a stat). Next, you could choose a geometric object to represent each observation in the transformed data. You could then use the aesthetic properties of the geoms to represent variables in the data. You would map the values of each variable to the levels of an aesthetic. You’d then select a coordinate system to place the geoms into, using the location of the objects (which is itself an aesthetic property) to display the values of the x and y variables.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output-display">
<p><img src="images/visualization-grammar.png" alt="A figure demonstrating the steps for going from raw data to table of counts where each row represents one level of cut and a count column shows how many diamonds are in that cut level." width="1332"/></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>At this point, you would have a complete graph, but you could further adjust the positions of the geoms within the coordinate system (a position adjustment) or split the graph into subplots (faceting). You could also extend the plot by adding one or more additional layers, where each additional layer uses a dataset, a geom, a set of mappings, a stat, and a position adjustment.</p>
<p>You could use this method to build <em>any</em> plot that you imagine. In other words, you can use the code template that you’ve learned in this chapter to build hundreds of thousands of unique plots.</p>
<p>If you’d like to learn more about the theoretical underpinnings of ggplot2, you might enjoy reading “<a href="https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf">The Layered Grammar of Graphics</a>”, the scientific paper that describes the theory of ggplot2 in detail.</p>

<h1>
Summary</h1>
<p>In this chapter you learned about the layered grammar of graphics starting with aesthetics and geometries to build a simple plot, facets for splitting the plot into subsets, statistics for understanding how geoms are calculated, position adjustments for controlling the fine details of position when geoms might otherwise overlap, and coordinate systems allow you fundamentally change what <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> mean. One layer we have not yet touched on is theme, which we will introduce in <a href="#sec-themes" data-type="xref">#sec-themes</a>.</p>
<p>Two very useful resources for getting an overview of the complete ggplot2 functionality are the ggplot2 cheatsheet (which you can find at <a href="https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets" class="uri">https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets</a> ) and the ggplot2 package website (<a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org</a>).</p>
<p>An important lesson you should take from this chapter is that when you feel the need for a geom that is not provided by ggplot2, it’s always a good idea to look into whether someone else has already solved your problem by creating a ggplot2 extension package that offers that geom.</p>
